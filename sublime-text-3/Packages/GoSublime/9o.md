9o is GoSublime's command-shell, press `ctrl+9` or `super+9` activate it.

It has two basic concepts: commands and actions.

Commands
========

Type `# ` (hash/number sign/pound sign [space]) to begin a command sequence e.g. `# help`', then press enter to execute it.

Actions
=======

Filename and other actionable text are highlighted (usually bold).
Place the cursor over these areas and press `ctrl+dot`,`ctrl+g`' (or `super+dot`,`super+g` on OS X) to open the corresponding file.
Alternatively, press `ctrl+shift`', (or `super+shift` on OS X) and left-click.

Command modes
=============

9o has two command modes: `sh` and `9o`.

In `sh` mode your commands are passed as-is without interpretation directly to your shell.
e.g. you might want to use special features of your shell like piping (`sh echo 123 | filter-cmd`)

For all other commands, the command line is split by spaces, taking quoted args into consideration
and then environment variables in each argument are expanded (as well as `~/` which
is short-hand for your `$HOME` directory) and then the command is executed.

If the command is not found(not a 9o builtin), it's treated as-if it was run via `sh`

Environment Variables
=====================

In `9o` mode, environment variables of the form `$NAME` and `${NAME}` are supported.

The following variables are defined for each command you execute. These will override any variable
of the same name that might've been inherited from your `shell` or the Sublime Text environment.
Additionally, these variables will be defined within the initial environment of all commands executed
through 9o, so they should appear inside commands run through your `shell`. Please be aware that your
shell might override these variables with its own, epecilly in the case of `$PWD`

* `$_wd` (or `$PWD`): the absolute path to the current working directory

* `$_fn`: the absolute path to the current active file. If the file hasn't been saved, this will be
          an empty string.

* `$_nm`: the base name of the current active file. If the file hasn't been saved, this will be n empty string

9o's commands
==================

* help: Present documentation for 9o and its supported commands

* build: build the current package

* run: build the current package. If it's a regular package run its tests otherwise(package main)
		   execute it. e.g. `run` or `run -flag1 -flag2=abc`

* replay: like `run` but attempts to cancel any active executions before running

* go: run the `go` command e.g. `go help`

* clear: clears the output panel

* tskill: lists or cancels active tasks.
	type `tskill` to show a palette containing a list of active tasks and their summary and cancel them where possible

	type `tskill [TASK ID]` to cancel the task. The task is represented by #TASK_ID. (you will be prompted with an ok/cancel dialog to confirm the action)

		[ tskill t1 | done ]
			kill t1: yes

	the following aliases can be used in place of task ids:
		`tskill replay` kill the last instance of the replay command
		`tskill go` kill the last instance of the go command `go run` etc. note, however that this may fail to actually kill the executable being run by `go run`

* settings: list settings as seen by GoSublime.
	type `settings` to get a listing of all settings.
	type `setting [NAME1] [NAME2] ...` to the value of the listed names

* env: list environment variables as seen/generated by GoSublime.
	type `env` to get a listing of all environment vars usable by GoSublime.
	type `env [NAME1] [NAME2] ...` to the value of the listed names

* share: share the active view's content on play.golang.org

* hist: manage command history
	type `hist` to list all historical commands
	type `hist erase` to erase all historical commands

* cd: change directory
	type `cd` to cd to the directory of the current file (like ctrl+9 does)
	type `cd ~/go` to cd to the `go` directory in your home directory
	type `cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/fmt` to cd the `src/pkg/fmt` in your GOROOT

* which: locate a command
	type `which` to list all builtins
	type `which cmd1 cmd2...` to locate the listed commands

* echo: output the specified arguments
	type `echo $_fn` to output the path to the current file (if it has a name on-disk)

Executing commands
==================

When you run a command e.g. `replay`, its line is replaced with the command followed by and hour glass
and a new prompt is initialised. When the command completes a its output is printed and the hour glass
replaced with a summary.

	[ /go ] # replay
		|
		v
	[ replay âŒ› ]
	[ /go ] #
		|
		v
	[ replay | done: 2.987ms ]
		hello world
	[ /go ] #


Command History
===============

In the 9o autocompletion menu, old commands are listed in the (reversed) order they were last executed.
They are prefixed with a carret(^) e.g. `^1 replay`. In addition to being able to autocomplete them,
you can also expand them by their alias(without execution). To do so, type the alias and press [enter] e.g.

	[ /go ] # ^1

is replaced with:

	[ /go ] # replay


To expand and execute an old command by its alias, use two carrets e.g.

	[ /go ] # ^^1

executes the last command:

	[ `replay` | done: 2.557ms ]
		hello world
