## Stop!

**Before you submit an issue on Github, please do the following:**

- Read the [installation](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) and [troubleshooting](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/troubleshooting.html) documentation.

- Search the deprecated [SublimeLinter google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sublimelinter).

- Search all the other issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3/issues).

- If your issue is specific to a particular linter, report the issue on that
  linter's repository instead.

Thank you!
