SublimeLinter 3.4.0
--------------------
Setting values may now contain tokens:

- ${project}: the project's base directory, if available.
- ${directory}: the dirname of the current view's file.
- ${env:<x>}: the environment variable 'x'.
- ${home}: the user's $HOME directory.

${project} and ${directory} expansion are dependent on having a window.

For example, here are project settings that use a project-relative path:

{
    "SublimeLinter": {
        "linters": {
            "pylint": {
                "paths":
                [
                    "${project}/source/"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
