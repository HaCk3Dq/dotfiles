SublimeLinter 3.0.15
---------------------

- A new method was added, persist.debug_mode, to make it easier
  for linter plugins to determine if the user has debug mode
  turned on. Returns True if "debug" setting is on.

- Linters can now declare themselves as universal by setting
  the syntax to '*'. '*' can also be used as a key in selectors.
  See the SublimeLinter-annotations plugin for an example.

- When specifying a list setting as a string, for example:

    "annotations": {
        "warnings": "FOO, BAR",
    }

  in non-inline setting you can now put whitespace around
  the separator. Note that space may not be used around the
  separator if the setting is inline.

- Fixed some problems related to unexpected ST3 behavior.
