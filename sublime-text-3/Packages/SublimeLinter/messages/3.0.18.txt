SublimeLinter 3.0.18
---------------------
- Hopefully dealing correctly with gems under rbenv/rvm now.

- Added Linter.config_file attribute for automating config file
  lookup. See the Writing Linters docs for more info.

- @ may be used as a prefix for arguments in the Linter.defaults attribute.
  It suppresses output of the arg name, allowing you to use a named
  inline setting/override and only have the values passed in the
  linter command. See the Writing Linters docs for more info.
