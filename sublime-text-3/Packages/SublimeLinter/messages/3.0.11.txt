SublimeLinter 3.0.11
---------------------

- Support was added for ruby-based linters via a new RubyLinter class.
  This class makes ruby-based linters work with rbenv and (hopefully)
  rvm. It also preserves your GEM_HOME when running ruby-based linters.
  See the documentation for more info.

- Some linters use html entitities in the error messages, so html
  entities in error messages are now decoded.
