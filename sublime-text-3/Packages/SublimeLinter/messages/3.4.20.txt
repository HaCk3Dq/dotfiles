SublimeLinter 3.4.20
---------------------

SAVE SUBLIMELINTER!

After a year of working on SublimeLinter, the time has come for me to pass the torch.
I am grateful to everyone who valued SublimeLinter enough to donate, and also to those
who contributed code, but I can no longer afford to maintain or support SublimeLinter
and its many linter plugins.

I am looking for developers who are willing to take over coding and/or support.
If you are interested, please leave a comment at:
