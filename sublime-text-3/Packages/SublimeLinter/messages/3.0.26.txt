SublimeLinter 3.0.26
---------------------
- I have switched back to .zshenv as the recommended place
  to put PATH augmentations for zsh. On Ubuntu, shells are
  not started as login shells by default in terminals, which
  prevented .zprofile from loading. If anyone has trouble
  using .zshenv, let me know.

- Added Retina icons for the Default and Circle gutter themes.
