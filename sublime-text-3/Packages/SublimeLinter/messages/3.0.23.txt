SublimeLinter 3.0.23
---------------------
- If no gutter marks are showing and there is no column in
  an error message, the entire line is highlighted.

- When specifying inline settings, "SublimeLinter" is now
  case-insensitive, so for example both "[SublimeLinter flake8-ignore:E201]"
  and "[sublimelinter flake8-ignore:E201]" will work.

- If you are using a node-based linter (like jshint), nvm,
  zsh, and oh-my-zsh, do **not** install the nvm plugin for
  oh-my-zsh. It interferes with SublimeLinterâ€™s ability to
  find the path to node.

- Fixed some bugs relating to default settings.
