SublimeLinter 3.0.28
---------------------

I am very grateful to everyone who has created linter plugins and made
the commitment to maintain and support them.

SublimeLinter is only as good as its linters, so I feel every linter
released to the public should be up to the standards I am holding
myself to with SublimeLinter. As a result, I have taken the following
step:

- We have moved all of the SublimeLinter linter plugins to a private channel.
  In the future, any requests for publishing through Package Control will
  be vetted for basic correctness.

- Linter plugins that are not in the SublimeLinter org on github have
  been renamed to SublimeLinter-contrib-*, so users can know that these
  are user-contributed, vs. the "official" linters in the SublimeLinter
  org.

- When creating a linter plugin using the "Create Linter Plugin" command,
  the name is SublimeLinter-contrib-* name.

Of course I want as many linters as possible in the SublimeLinter org.
Anyone who is willing to have their plugin vetted and is willing to
maintain and support their linter will be welcome in the org.

Thank you for your support!
