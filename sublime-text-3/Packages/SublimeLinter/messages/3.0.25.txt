SublimeLinter 3.0.25
---------------------
- If you have multiple views of the same buffer open, even in multiple
  windows, the highlights, gutter marks and status messages are kept in sync.

- On Mac OS X, a syntax file will load even if the capitalization of its
  filename extension is not ".tmLanguage". On other platforms it will not
  load. But since it at least works on Mac OS X, SublimeLinter will allow
  it when resolving syntaxes.

- Added CONTRIBUTING.md, so github issues will showing something about
  the guidelines for contributing.

- Linter.config_file now allows for an abitrary number of auxiliary
  search directories to be searched, and '~' is expanded. This allows
  for linters like jshint to provide the native functionality of
  searching the file hierarchy and the home directory.
