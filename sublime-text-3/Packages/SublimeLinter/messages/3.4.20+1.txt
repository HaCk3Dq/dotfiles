* Good news, everyone! *
************************

We have had great support recently and are truly 
thankful to everyone who has wished Aparajita a 
fond farewell. We expect he will continue to 
contribute in the future and appreciate the 
amazing stewardship he has shown to the project.

Please join us in welcoming Blake (@skj3gg) as 
the new project administrator for the SublimeLinter 
organization. We know the project will continue 
for a long time to come with this new change in 
leadership. Our number one priority will always be
to help developers craft better code.

As a final note, all donations will continue to go
to Aparajita until November 14, 2014, so please
consider thanking him for his services before that
time.
