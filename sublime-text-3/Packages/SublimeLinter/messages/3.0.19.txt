SublimeLinter 3.0.19
---------------------
- Previously, when a linter plugin name had a dash in it, for example
  SublimeLinter-foo-bar, the inline setting name was "foobar",
  which could lead to confusion. Now both "foobar" and "foo-bar"
  are recognized as inline setting names.

- Fixed a bug with argument generation in some linters.
