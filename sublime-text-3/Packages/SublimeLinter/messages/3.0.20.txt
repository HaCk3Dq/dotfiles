SublimeLinter 3.0.20
---------------------
- When using the "Create Linter Plugin" command, an executable name
  with dashes will be converted into a camel-case class name. For
  example, scss-lint becomes ScssLint.

- Added .gitignore with .DS_Store to the linter plugin template.

- You may now define a linter as file-only by setting its tempfile_suffix
  to '-', which means that linter will only run when its view is not dirty.
